            <p> Hi I'm ImtotallyNotNew.
                I'm currently developing my own 2D story driven platformer called 
                PROJECT PROTO. My goal is to be in the games industry and make change or 
                help development games just like the ones that defined my childhood and 
                truly made me fall in love with gaming.

                The game I'm excited for currently is Starfield! I am a huge fan of Bethesda
                and from everything shown Starfield looks incredible and in my opinion has the potential
                to be the best Bethesda game yet! I will be there at midnight ready to dive in!
