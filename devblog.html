        <p>
            PROJECT PROTO is a game about a small little robot called PROTO who ends up on Earth
            and upon landing on this mysterious new planet PROTO must find purpose. On his
            journey he will discover many new emotions and discover friendship.

            The core mechanics of the game are finished with some tweaks
            and balancing expected as the game grows and more and more
            levels are made. The level design is still currently being
            worked on to make the game as perfect, fun and replayable
            as it can be. The game still has no expected release date but
            I do plan on releasing several demos and previews of the game so
            be on the lookout for those!
